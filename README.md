# Abuse IP blacklist
Abusive IP blacklist gathered on my servers and routers

These lists (1-day, 7-day and 30-day) are here mainly for my personal use, gathered by my servers and distributed back to exchange abusive IP blacklists between firewalls. These lists are updated once a day.

All of the IPs (IPv4 /32 and IPv6 /128) are gathered from the logs only - abusing SSH, SMTP, etc.

There are no way to "whitelist" or to remove from the list - the only way to remove is wait a while (1, 7, 30 days) and stop abusing my servers.

Geolocation of all the servers is Czech Republic, Europe.

Use it if like it.
